# Report App HeyCar

This project was developed with Typescript, NextJs and React


Before running you should:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn add/install
```

To run locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To be improved:
- CSS: mostly on the Dashboard when the Chart is displayed
- Unit testing: there is a lot of code to be covered by jest, but this will require more time
- Refactor some utils: there were some functions that could be optimized, and also be separated from the main components, in a `hooks` file for instance
